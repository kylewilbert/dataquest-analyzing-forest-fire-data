# dataquest-analyzing-forest-fire-data
*This is a Guided Project I completed for the Data Analyst/Data Science path on Dataquest. Dataquest does provide solution code that is available while completing this project. As a result, I do not claim that all of this code is mine or original. At times when I got stuck or when my code didn't fit the direction of the guided analysis, I matched their code for the sake of completing the exercise and learning the structure of the analysis. So while the code is not 100% original or unique, I believe one of the strengths of these projects is that it helps students like me identify business problems where analysis like this can be valuable. As a result, I'm confident that I can adapt this particular analysis to similar business problems I may face in my day-to-day work.*

## Introduction
A brief guided project from Dataquest where we explored data related to forest fires. We investigated during what days and months fires were most common using tidyverse tools to reshape the data and ggplot2 to visualize it.

### Methods Used
- exploratory data analysis

### Technologies Used
- R
    - dplyr
    - readr
    - purrr
    - ggplot2
